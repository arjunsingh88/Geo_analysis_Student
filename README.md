# Geographic Analysis of Student(potential and current) 
An analysis of prospective and current student data. The aim for this project is to constitute a geographical database of EISTI’s students with their personal address, campus address and the addresses where their internships took place. Having that, some statistics will be performed to calculate the distance between: « home – campus », « home – internships location » and « campus – internships location » respectively. These statistics will serve to know the search trends and to generate a classification in order to help users in charge of business relations.

## Development Phase
#### `Phase I`: Information gathering and Data cleaning. 
* Reading CSV and Formalize data
* Select and Treat All Blank Cells with duplicates
* Convert Numbers Stored as Text into Numbers
*	Change Text to Lower/Upper/Proper Case and Spell Check

#### `Phase II`:	Univariate and Bivariate Data Analysis
*	Univariate
    * Student Demographic (Year, Campus, location )
    * Enterprise based analysis (Remuneration analysis,Location)
    * College (program , location)
*	Bivariate
    * Correlation between Student ,Enterprise and College 

#### `Phase III`:	Statistical Integration 
* Categorical and numerical analysis, Estimators w.r.t corresponding the variables like SD, Skewness, Kurtosis, plots and charts.
*	Data modeling 
    * Clustering (location, campus, program)
    * Regression, forecasting, rules and Trend Analysis
    * geo mapping of location distance « home <–> campus », « home <–> internships location » and « campus <–> internships location »

#### `Phase IV`:	Application development
*	User interface development
*	Database Implementation
*	Applying Analysis with data and Integrating with interface.

#### `Phase V`:	Product Implementation 
*	Deployment of Web API on Server

#### `Phase VI`:	Conduct Testing
*	Preparing Test Cases (like Admin and User Login)
